🧾 1. VIEW – Virtual Table
💡 Concept:

A view is a saved SQL query that behaves like a virtual table.
It doesn’t store data itself — it just displays data from one or more real tables.

🧠 Example:

CREATE VIEW student_details AS
SELECT name, department, marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 60;


Now you can use it like a table:

SELECT * FROM student_details;

🗣️ Interview Questions:

Q1. What is a view in SQL?
👉 A view is a virtual table that displays data from one or more tables using a SELECT query.

Q2. What are the advantages of using views?
✅ Simplifies complex queries
✅ Provides data security (can hide sensitive columns)
✅ Easier to manage frequently used queries

Q3. Can we update data through a view?
👉 Yes, if the view is based on a single table and doesn’t contain GROUP BY, DISTINCT, or aggregate functions.

⚡ 2. INDEX – Improves Query Speed
💡 Concept:

An index in SQL works like an index in a book — it helps the database find data faster without scanning the entire table.

🧠 Example:

CREATE INDEX idx_student_name
ON students(name);


This will make queries using the name column faster:

SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = 'Santosh';

🗣️ Interview Questions:

Q1. What is an index in SQL?
👉 An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval on a database table.

Q2. Types of Indexes?
✅ Clustered Index
✅ Non-Clustered Index
✅ Unique Index

Q3. What are the disadvantages of indexes?
👉 Indexes make reads faster but slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations because the index also needs updating.

🔄 3. TRANSACTION – Ensures Data Consistency
💡 Concept:

A transaction is a group of SQL statements that are executed together.
If one fails, the whole transaction can be rolled back to maintain consistency.

ACID Properties:

A – Atomicity → All or nothing

C – Consistency → Database remains valid

I – Isolation → Transactions don’t affect each other

D – Durability → Changes stay after commit

🧠 Example:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE acc_no = 101;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE acc_no = 102;

COMMIT; -- saves the changes
-- or
ROLLBACK; -- cancels the transaction

🗣️ Interview Questions:

Q1. What is a transaction?
👉 A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit of work.

Q2. What are COMMIT and ROLLBACK?
✅ COMMIT: Saves the changes permanently.
✅ ROLLBACK: Undoes the changes if there’s an error.

Q3. What is ACID property in SQL?
👉 It defines the reliability of a transaction (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
