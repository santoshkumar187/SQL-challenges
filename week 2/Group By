ðŸ”¹ What is GROUP BY?

The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups.
Itâ€™s mostly used with aggregate functions like:

COUNT() â€“ count rows

SUM() â€“ total

AVG() â€“ average

MIN() â€“ smallest value

MAX() â€“ largest value

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;

ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Counting employees per department

Letâ€™s say you have a table employees like this ðŸ‘‡

emp_id	name	dept
1	Raj	HR
2	Meena	IT
3	Ramesh	HR
4	Neha	IT
5	Rahul	Sales

Now, to find how many employees are in each department:

SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;


âœ… Output:

dept	total_employees
HR	2
IT	2
