🧩 1. Primary Key

Definition:
A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

It cannot be NULL

It must be unique

🧠 Each table can have only one Primary Key, but it can consist of multiple columns (called a Composite Key).

Example:

CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);


Here, student_id uniquely identifies each student — no duplicates, no NULLs.

🔑 2. Composite Key

Definition:
A Composite Key is a Primary Key made up of two or more columns.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Course_Enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);


Here, the combination of (student_id, course_id) uniquely identifies each record — not individually, but together.

🧷 3. Foreign Key

Definition:
A Foreign Key is used to link two tables.
It refers to the Primary Key of another table, ensuring referential integrity.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);


Here, dept_id in Employees refers to dept_id in Departments.
This ensures you can’t assign an employee to a department that doesn’t exist.

💎 4. Unique Key

Definition:
A Unique Key ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it can have one NULL value (unlike Primary Key).

Example:

CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);


Here, two users can’t have the same email, but one record can have NULL in that column.

📎 5. Candidate Key

Definition:
A Candidate Key is any column (or set of columns) that can uniquely identify a record in a table.
Among all candidate keys, one is chosen as the Primary Key.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT,
    roll_no INT,
    email VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id),
    UNIQUE (roll_no),
    UNIQUE (email)
);


Here:

student_id, roll_no, and email — all are candidate keys

student_id is chosen as the Primary Key

🪶 6. Alternate Key

Definition:
A Candidate Key that is not selected as the Primary Key is called an Alternate Key.

Example (continued from above):

roll_no and email are Alternate Keys

student_id is the Primary Key

📘 7. Super Key

Definition:
A Super Key is any set of columns that uniquely identifies a record — it can include extra unnecessary columns too.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(50),
    phone VARCHAR(15)
);


Here:

{emp_id} — Super Key

{emp_id, email} — also a Super Key

{email, phone} — also a Super Key

👉 The minimal super key (no extra attributes) is the Candidate Key.

🧱 8. Surrogate Key

Definition:
A Surrogate Key is a system-generated unique identifier, often used when there’s no natural primary key in data.
Usually implemented as an auto-incremented ID.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    order_date DATE
);



| Key Type          | Description                               | Can be NULL | Can Duplicate | Example                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Primary Key**   | Uniquely identifies each record           | ❌           | ❌             | `student_id`              |
| **Composite Key** | Combination of two or more columns as PK  | ❌           | ❌             | `(student_id, course_id)` |
| **Foreign Key**   | References another table’s PK             | ✅           | ✅             | `dept_id` in Employees    |
| **Unique Key**    | Ensures unique values in a column         | ✅ (one)     | ❌             | `email`                   |
| **Candidate Key** | All possible unique identifiers           | ❌           | ❌             | `student_id`, `email`     |
| **Alternate Key** | Candidate Key not chosen as PK            | ❌           | ❌             | `email`                   |
| **Super Key**     | Any key that uniquely identifies a record | ❌           | ❌             | `{emp_id, email}`         |
| **Surrogate Key** | Artificial key (auto-increment)           | ❌           | ❌             | `order_id`                |
