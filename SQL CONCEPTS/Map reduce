🧠 What is MapReduce?
MapReduce is a programming model used for processing large datasets in a distributed computing environment. It was popularized by Google and is the foundation of systems like Hadoop.

It works in two main phases:

Map: Breaks down the input data into key-value pairs.

Reduce: Aggregates those pairs to produce the final result.

📚 Word Count Example
Imagine you have a huge collection of documents and you want to count how many times each word appears.

🔹 Map Phase
Each document is processed independently. The mapper reads the text and emits key-value pairs:

Code
Input: "Hello world Hello"
Output: ("Hello", 1), ("world", 1), ("Hello", 1)
🔹 Shuffle & Sort (Behind the scenes)
All the key-value pairs are grouped by key:

Code
Grouped: ("Hello", [1, 1]), ("world", [1])
🔹 Reduce Phase
The reducer sums the values for each key:

Code
Output: ("Hello", 2), ("world", 1)
💬 Interview POV Tips
Highlight scalability: “MapReduce is designed to scale across thousands of machines.”

Mention fault tolerance: “If a node fails, the system reassigns the task automatically.”

Use real-world analogy: “Think of it like splitting a big task among friends, then combining everyone's results.”



sql
SELECT word, 1 AS count
FROM documents
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(text_column, ' ')
documents is your table.

text_column contains the text.

STRING_SPLIT breaks the text into words (available in SQL Server; other databases may use different functions).

🔹 Reduce Phase Equivalent in SQL
In MapReduce, the Reduce phase aggregates counts by word. In SQL, this is a GROUP BY:

sql
SELECT word, SUM(count) AS total_count
FROM (
    SELECT word, 1 AS count
    FROM documents
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(text_column, ' ')
) AS word_counts
GROUP BY word
ORDER BY total_count DESC
