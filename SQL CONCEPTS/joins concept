SQL JOINs allow combining data from two or more tables based on related columns, 
making it possible to answer complex queries about relational data from beginner to advanced levels.​

Beginner: What is a JOIN?
A JOIN is a SQL operation that merges rows from two tables based on a common column, 
typically a primary key in one table and a foreign key in the other. 
This operation helps retrieve information scattered across multiple tables, producing a single unified result.​

Core JOIN Types
INNER JOIN: Returns only rows with matching values in both tables. This is the most common and retrieves intersecting records.​

sql
SELECT A.col1, B.col2
FROM TableA A
INNER JOIN TableB B ON A.shared_col = B.shared_col;
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table; 
NULLs are shown when no match is found.​

sql
SELECT A.col1, B.col2
FROM TableA A
LEFT JOIN TableB B ON A.shared_col = B.shared_col;
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and any matched from the left table, with NULLs for missing matches.​

sql
SELECT A.col1, B.col2
FROM TableA A
RIGHT JOIN TableB B ON A.shared_col = B.shared_col;
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all rows with matches in either table; unmatched columns are returned as NULL.​

sql
SELECT A.col1, B.col2
FROM TableA A
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB B ON A.shared_col = B.shared_col;
CROSS JOIN: Returns every combination of rows from the two tables (Cartesian product), rarely used except in special cases.​

SELF JOIN: A table joined to itself to compare rows within the same table, commonly for hierarchical or relational data.​

Professional: Advanced JOIN Techniques
Non-Equi JOIN: Uses operators (<, >, <=, >=, <>) for complex row matching, for advanced custom joins.​

sql
SELECT A.col1, B.col2
FROM TableA A
INNER JOIN TableB B ON A.num_col >= B.num_col;
Semi-Join: Returns rows from one table that have matches in another (usually using EXISTS or IN for subqueries).​

sql
SELECT col1 FROM A WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM B WHERE B.shared_col = A.shared_col);
Anti-Join: Retrieves rows from one table that do not have matches in another, often with NOT EXISTS.​

Common Use Cases
Connecting user profiles with login activities (INNER JOIN)

Listing all employees, even those without department assignments (LEFT JOIN)

Getting all departments, including those without employees (RIGHT JOIN)

Combining results from multiple sources (FULL JOIN)

Analyzing all combinations (CROSS JOIN), such as products and stores
