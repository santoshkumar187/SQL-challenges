### ðŸ“‹ Sample `Orders` Table

| order_id | customer_id | order_date  |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 101      | 1           | 2025-10-20  |
| 102      | 2           | 2025-10-18  |
| 103      | 1           | 2025-10-15  |
| 104      | 3           | 2025-10-10  |
| 105      | 1           | 2025-10-05  |
| 106      | 2           | 2025-10-03  |
| 107      | 1           | 2025-10-01  |
| 108      | 2           | 2025-09-30  |
| 109      | 4           | 2025-10-22  |
| 110      | 2           | 2025-10-21  |

Assuming today's date is **2025-10-25**, the query:

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Orders
WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

### âœ… Output

| customer_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 2           |

**Explanation:**
- **Customer 1** has 4 orders in the last month (Oct 1, 5, 15, 20)
- **Customer 2** has 4 orders in the last month (Oct 3, 18, 21, and one on Sep 30 which is *excluded*)
- Others have â‰¤ 1 order

Let me know if you'd like to simulate this with a different date range or join it with a `Customers` table to show names too!
