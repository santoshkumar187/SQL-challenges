🧩 Table Example: Students

1️⃣ Create Table

CREATE TABLE Students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);

💡 This creates a table named Students with 4 columns.


---

2️⃣ Insert Data

INSERT INTO Students VALUES
(1, 'Aarav', 21, 'Computer Science'),
(2, 'Neha', 22, 'Information Technology'),
(3, 'Karan', 20, 'Electronics');

💡 Adds 3 records into the table.


---

3️⃣ Select Data (Read Operation)

👉 Used to view data from the table.

SELECT * FROM Students;

Output:

id	name	age	course

1	Aarav	21	Computer Science
2	Neha	22	Information Technology
3	Karan	20	Electronics



---

4️⃣ Update Data (Modify Existing Record)

👉 Used to change data in a row.

UPDATE Students
SET age = 23
WHERE name = 'Neha';


---

5️⃣ Delete Data

👉 Used to remove a record.

DELETE FROM Students
WHERE id = 3;

After deletion, table becomes 👇

id	name	age	course

1	Aarav	21	Computer Science
2	Neha	23	Information Technology



---

6️⃣ Interview Key Points 💬

CREATE → make new table

INSERT → add new record

SELECT → read data

UPDATE → modify data

DELETE → remove data

Always use WHERE with UPDATE / DELETE (to avoid changing all rows)



Table Name: Students
