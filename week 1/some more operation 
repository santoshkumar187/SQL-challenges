SELECT â€“ Retrieving Data

ðŸ§  Concept

SELECT is used to read or query data from one or more tables.


---

ðŸ§© 1. Basic SELECT

Get all columns from a table:

SELECT * FROM Employees;

ðŸ‘‰ Shows every row and every column.


---

ðŸ§© 2. Select Specific Columns

SELECT name, salary FROM Employees;

ðŸ‘‰ Only shows name and salary columns.


---

ðŸ§© 3. Use WHERE Clause (Filtering)

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 50000;

ðŸ‘‰ Shows employees who earn more than 50,000.

Common operators:

Operator	Meaning	Example

=	Equal to	salary = 40000
>, <, >=, <=	Comparison	age > 25
!= or <>	Not equal to	id <> 2
BETWEEN	Range check	salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000
IN	Match list of values	dept IN ('IT', 'HR')
LIKE	Pattern match	name LIKE 'S%'



---

ðŸ§© 4. ORDER BY (Sorting Results)

SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

ðŸ‘‰ Sorts by salary (highest first).




Practice Exercise

Try creating a table and running these queries:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(1, 'Aarav', 'IT', 55000),
(2, 'Meera', 'HR', 48000),
(3, 'Karan', 'Finance', 62000),
(4, 'Neha', 'IT', 75000),
(5, 'Riya', 'HR', 52000);

Now practice:

1. Show all employees.


2. Show names and departments only.


3. Show employees in IT department.


4. Show top 3 highest-paid employees.


5. Show unique departments.

Table Data Recap

id	name	department	salary

1	Aarav	IT	55000.00
2	Meera	HR	48000.00
3	Karan	Finance	62000.00
4	Neha	IT	75000.00
5	Riya	HR	52000.00

âœ… 1. Show all employees

> Retrieve every column and every record.



SELECT * FROM Employees;

Output:

id	name	department	salary

1	Aarav	IT	55000.00
2	Meera	HR	48000.00
3	Karan	Finance	62000.00
4	Neha	IT	75000.00
5	Riya	HR	52000.00



---

âœ… 2. Show names and departments only

SELECT name, department FROM Employees;

Output:

name	department

Aarav	IT
Meera	HR
Karan	Finance
Neha	IT
Riya	HR



---

âœ… 3. Show employees in IT department

SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'IT';

Output:

id	name	department	salary

1	Aarav	IT	55000.00
4	Neha	IT	75000.00



---

âœ… 4. Show top 3 highest-paid employees

SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;

Output:

id	name	department	salary

4	Neha	IT	75000.00
3	Karan	Finance	62000.00
1	Aarav	IT	55000.00



---

âœ… 5. Show unique departments

SELECT DISTINCT department FROM Employees;

Output:

department

IT
HR
Finance

ðŸ’¡ Summary of Concepts Used:

SELECT * â†’ all data

SELECT col1, col2 â†’ specific columns

WHERE â†’ filter rows

ORDER BY + LIMIT â†’ sort and restrict results

DISTINCT â†’ remove duplicates
