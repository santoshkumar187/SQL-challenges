🔍 What is Filtering in SQL?
Filtering means selecting only the rows that meet certain conditions.

You use the WHERE clause to filter data.

🧪 Example:
sql
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Age = 14;
✅ This will show only students who are 14 years old.

🔢 What is Sorting in SQL?
Sorting means arranging the rows in a specific order — either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

You use the ORDER BY clause to sort data.

🧪 Example:
sql
SELECT * FROM Students
ORDER BY Grade DESC;
✅ This will show all students, sorted by their grade from highest to lowest.

🧠 Combine Filtering and Sorting
You can use both together!

🧪 Example:
sql
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Age > 13
ORDER BY Grade ASC;
✅ This shows students older than 13, sorted by grade from lowest to highest.
