What is SQL?

SQL = Structured Query Language

It is used to talk to a database (create, read, update, delete data).

Think of SQL like a language for asking questions from your data.


What is a Table?

A table is like an Excel sheet.

It has rows (data records) and columns (fields).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

id  	name	  salary
1   	Alice	  60000.00
2	    Bob	    55000.0


Row and Column

Row â†’ one complete record (like Aliceâ€™s details).

Column â†’ one field of data (like "salary").



  
  Hereâ€™s the SQL query example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (     ->makes new table name called employee.
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,      -> id is number, and its unque for each employee
    name VARCHAR(50),        -> name is text column holds 50 character
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)     -> salary is number 10 digit max and after decimal (12345678.90)
);


After running this, you now have a table Employees ready to store data like:

id	 name   	salary
1     sanjay   50000
2     santosh  40000
